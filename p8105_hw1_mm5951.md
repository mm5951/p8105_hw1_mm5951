# Problem 1

## Load dataset

First, I’ll **load the provided dataset** for this exercise.

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

## Dataset description

Next, I will briefly describe the **key characteristics** of the
**“penguins” dataset**. I’ll first use the `skmr::skim`function to print
out a summary of the dataset. The “penguins” dataset contains 344 rows
and 8 columns. That corresponds to the data of n=8 different variables
(columns) from n=344 penguins (rows).

The “penguins” dataset contains: \* 5 numerical variables
(“bill_length_mm”, “bill_depth_mm”, “flipper_length_mm”, “body_mass_g”
and “year”), and \* 3 factorial ones (“species”, “island” and “sex”).

As a summary, using the mean output, the average penguin will measure
43.92 mm in height and 17.15 mm in depth, have a flipper length of
200.92 mm and weight 4.2 kg. The overall dataset contains n=168 male and
n=165 female from 3 main species (Adelie n=152, Gentoo n=124 and
Chinstrap n=68). The data was collected between the years 2007-09.

``` r
skimr::skim(penguins)
```

Alternatively, as per homework instructions, I could have used the
`nrow`and `ncol` functions to return the number of rows and columns of
the specified matrix (“penguins”), respectively.

``` r
nrow(penguins)
```

    ## [1] 344

``` r
ncol(penguins)
```

    ## [1] 8

## Graphic outputs

Next, with the `ggplot`function, I will **produce a scatter plot** of
the variables flipper_length_mm (y) vs bill_length_mm (x), using
different color points for each species.

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point()
```

Finally, using the `ggsave`function I will **save the scatter plot** in
.png format into the project directory.

``` r
ggsave("scatterplot.png")
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point).

# Problem 2

## Create a data frame

First, I will create a data frame using the `tibble`function,
incorporating the following elements:

-   a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
-   a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are
    greater than 0
-   a character vector of length 10
-   a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

``` r
Hw1_df = tibble(
  samp = rnorm(n = 10),
  vec_logical = samp > 0,
  vec_char = c("This", "is", "homework", "one", "solution", "for", "data", "science", "class", "fall" ),
  vec_factor = factor(c("male", "male", "female", "female", "nonbinary", "nonbinary", "male", "female", "nonbinary", "male"))
)
```

## Calculate means

Next, I will calculate the mean of some of the objects as created above
using the `mean` function. To do so, first I will pull each variable
(using the function `pull`)and name them y1-y4 following the order in
which they appear in the dataframe.

``` r
y1 = pull(.data = Hw1_df, var = samp)
y2 = pull(.data = Hw1_df, var = vec_logical)
y3 = pull(.data = Hw1_df, var = vec_char)
y4 = pull(.data = Hw1_df, var = vec_factor)
```

Then the means are calculated. For the numerical variable, results will
be rounded to 3 decimals using the `round` function.

``` r
round(
  mean(y1), 3
  )
```

    ## [1] 0.111

``` r
mean(y2)
```

    ## [1] 0.5

``` r
mean(y3)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(y3): argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(y4)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(y4): argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

As a result of the chunk code, I obtain the mean for “y1 = samp” (data
type: numerical) and “y2 = vec_logical (data type: logical), which are
0.069 and 0.5, respectively. Note that given that y1 is a random sample,
would the session be re-started and the .Rmd re-knitted, values might
change.

Conversely, I get a warning message for the remaining two variables,
given that the data type of some of the vectors is not numerical nor
logical, rather character (“y3 = vec_char”) or factor (“y4 =
vec_factor”).

## Convert variable types

Finally, I will convert the logical, character, and factor variables
into numerical using the `as.numeric` function. For each variable, I
will use the `pull`function, so that they can be addressed separately
from the “Hw1_df” dataframe. Note the chunk is shown, but not the
output, as per homework instructions.

``` r
as.numeric(y2)
as.numeric(y3)
as.numeric(y4)
```

The “vec_logical” and “vec_factor” are coerced into numeric elements,
following a logical rationale (for instance, in “vec_logical”, TRUE=1
and FALSE=0; in “vec_factor”, its 3 levels are converted into female=1,
male=2, nonbinary=3 according to their alphabetical order). The
character vector “vec_char” is more challenging, given that there’s no
logical conversion possible with the provided criteria, and R coerces
its 10 elements to NAs.

The kind of data contained in each variable determines whether a mean
can be calculated. In general, means can be calculated for numerical and
logical vectors (in the latter, using the TRUE=1 and FALSE=0 coercion).
Once converted into numerical, the mean of the remaining two vectors
could be calculated (not required as per homework instructions).

That’s it for homework 1!
